# Saas Landing Page

The **SaaS Landing Page** project is designed to **elevate** my front-end development skills by crafting a visually striking dark-themed landing page for a SaaS application using Next.js 14, Shadcn UI, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. This initiative not only aims to refine my expertise in these technologies but also to master Framer Motion, enabling the creation of smooth, professional animations that enhance the user experience and add vibrancy to the landing page. 

It's a compact yet impactful project that sets the foundation for my future endeavors.

> This project includes elements adapted from "SaaS Website UI Kit" by Framer. Retrieved from [Source Link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1347551304372055519).
